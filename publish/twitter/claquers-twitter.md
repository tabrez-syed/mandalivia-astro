🧵 Ever heard of a "claquer"? In 19th-century theaters, they were hired to clap, laugh, and even cry to guide the audience's reactions. Why would anyone do that? 🤔

Here's how it worked: (1/5)

Humans are social animals, and we often mirror the behavior of those around us. This desire to fit in is why claquers were so effective at creating an enthusiastic atmosphere. (2/5)

Claques had specific roles: the "rieur" (laugher), the "pleureur" (crier), and the "bisseur" (encore-demander). They'd strategically react to influence the crowd. 🎭 (3/5)

But some claques turned to blackmail, threatening to boo unless paid. This dark side led to their eventual decline. 😬 (4/5)

The psychology of claquers still exists today. Are we always reacting genuinely, or are we just keeping up with the crowd? Perhaps social media influencers are the new claquers of our time! 🧐 (5/5)
