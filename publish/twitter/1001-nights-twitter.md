ðŸ§µ Ever wonder how a good story can keep you hooked? It's a trick storytellers have used for centuries.

Let me tell you about Scheherazade from "The 1001 Nights"... (1/5)

Once upon a time, there was a grumpy king who would marry a new wife every day and then execute them! Then came Scheherazade, who had a clever plan. (2/5)

On her first night, she began telling the king a story. But just when it got really exciting, she stopped! "What happens next?" the king asked, totally hooked. (3/5)

Scheherazade knew the secret of a good cliffhanger - a little hook that catches our imagination and won't let go. She kept the king eager for more for 1001 nights! (4/5)

Next time you're reading, see if you can spot the cliffhangers. Where does the chapter end? Does it make you want to keep reading? âœ¨ (5/5)
