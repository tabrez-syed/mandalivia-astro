Rea,

Is stress bad for you? It seems like such a simple question, doesn't it? We often say "I'm so stressed!" like it's always a bad thing, and that we need to find ways to not be stressed. But what if this isn't quite right? What if stress isn't our enemy, but actually our body's way of helping us?

You see, stress isn't something outside of us - it's how our body responds to challenges. When your heart races, your breathing quickens, and your muscles tense up, that's your body preparing you to perform at your best. Think about when you're running in a soccer game. Your heart pounds, your breathing changes, and your palms get sweaty. These are the exact same physical reactions we might get before a big presentation or test, but in sports, we welcome these sensations as signs we're ready for action!

I love how you came up with the word "nervecited" - it perfectly captures this idea that these feelings can be both nervous and exciting at the same time. And science shows you're onto something really important! In a study with college students preparing for a big test (much like the research you participated in at UT), researchers found something remarkable. When students were taught to see their stress response - racing heart, sweaty palms, butterflies in stomach - as their body's way of energizing them for the challenge ahead, they actually performed better on their tests than students who weren't taught this perspective.

Isn't it cool that something as simple (but not easy!) as changing how we think about stress can change how it affects us? Psychologists call this the "stress-is-enhancing mindset," but I think your word "nervecited" captures it perfectly!

This makes me wonder - are there some situations where it's easier for you to feel "nervecited" rather than just stressed? For me, I used to get very stressed when running late. But now I try to focus on being safe and remind myself that it's better to arrive late than not arrive at all! This  shift in how I think about it helps me stay calmer.

The next time you feel those familiar signs of stress - racing heart, butterfly stomach, sweaty palms - try to remember that these are actually your body's way of helping you rise to a challenge. Your body is getting ready to help you do something amazing!

Love,
Abba

P.S. Can you think of a time when feeling "nervecited" actually helped you do better at something?
