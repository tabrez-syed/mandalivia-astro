Dear Rea,

Yesterday, I told you about Pavlov and his dogs. Today, I want to introduce you to B.F. Skinner, another influential psychologist who expanded on those ideas.

Skinner believed that our actions are shaped by the consequences that follow them. He called this idea "operant conditioning." It's a fancy term, but the concept is simple: behaviors that lead to good outcomes are likely to be repeated, while those that lead to bad outcomes are likely to be avoided.

To test his theories, Skinner created something called a "Skinner box." Imagine a small room with a lever and a hungry rat inside. At first, the rat might accidentally press the lever while exploring. Surprise! A piece of food appears. Soon, the rat learns that pressing the lever means food, and it starts doing it more often.

This might sound simple, but Skinner believed this process explains a lot about how we learn and why we do what we do. Think about it: when you study hard and get good grades, you feel proud and maybe get praised by your teachers. That good feeling makes you more likely to study hard again in the future.

Skinner's ideas were so influential that they're still used today in many areas of life. For example, Duo Lingo gives you points or badges for practicing every day? That's Skinner's theory in action! The app is using rewards to encourage you to keep learning.

Or consider how we train pets. When a dog sits on command and gets a treat, it's more likely to sit when told in the future. That's operant conditioning at work!

But Skinner's ideas aren't just about rewards. He also studied how punishments affect behavior. The beeping sound a car makes when you don't put on your seatbelt? That's a mild form of punishment designed to encourage safe behavior.

While not everyone agrees with all of Skinner's ideas today, his work has had a huge impact on how we understand behavior. Next time you find yourself doing something out of habit, or notice how you're encouraged to act in certain ways, think about Skinner. You might start seeing examples of operant conditioning all around you!

Love,
Abba
