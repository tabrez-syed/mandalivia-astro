Rea,

You've been learning about decimal points in math class lately - those tiny dots that tell us where to split up our numbers. They might seem like such a small thing, but put one in the wrong place and it can change everything! Let me tell you about the time a single misplaced decimal point cost an airline millions of dollars...

In 2006, Alitalia Airlines was selling tickets from Toronto to Cyprus. These were fancy business-class seats that were supposed to cost $3,900. But when someone was entering prices into the computer system, they put the decimal point in the wrong place, and suddenly the tickets were on sale for just $39!

Think about it this way: it's like if you went to the grocery store to buy your favorite sushi boxes. Usually, one box costs about $10. Imagine if someone accidentally marked them as $0.10 instead. That means you could buy 100 boxes of sushi for the same price as 1 box! That's the same kind of mistake the airline made - the decimal point being off by two places meant tickets that should cost $3,900 were selling for just $39.

Before anyone at the airline noticed the mistake, thousands of people had already bought tickets. When they finally caught the error, Alitalia had a big decision to make. Should they cancel all those tickets and tell everyone it was just a mistake? Or should they keep their word and honor the price, even though it would cost them millions of dollars?

The airline decided to do the right thing. They let everyone who bought a ticket keep it at the $39 price. This decision ended up costing them $7.2 million - all because of one tiny decimal point in the wrong place! While this was really expensive for the airline, they earned something valuable: their customers' trust.

Those decimal points you're practicing in math class? They're not just numbers on a page - they can change the real world in amazing ways. A single dot can mean the difference between $39 and $3,900, between a small mistake and millions of dollars. Sometimes the math skills we learn in school end up being way more important than we ever imagined.

Love,
Abba

P.S. Next time you're working with decimal points in math class, remember the airline's $7.2 million dot!
