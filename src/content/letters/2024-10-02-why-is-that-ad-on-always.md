Rea,

I've noticed we've been watching more TV lately, thanks to the debates and football season. Have you picked up on how some ads seem to play over and over? At first glance, it might seem like a waste of time. After all, why would they repeat an ad we just saw a few minutes ago? Well, it turns out advertisers are pretty clever and understand how our brains work. And believe it or not, you can use the same technique they use to improve your test preparation!

Our brains are constantly trying to figure out what information is important to keep and what can be discarded. They use a simple shortcut: if we see the same information repeatedly, our brain assumes it must be important. However, if we don't use that information for a while, we start to forget it.

Advertisers use a strategy called "*pulsing*" to take advantage of this. They alternate between periods of intense advertising (repeating the same ad frequently) and periods of no advertising. This tricks our brain into thinking the information is important and then prevents us from forgetting it. Interestingly, this approach actually allows them to spend less money in the long run while still keeping their message fresh in our minds.

Does this sound familiar? It should, because it's very similar to how you use flashcards for school! When you review your flashcards, you're essentially "advertising" to your brain that this information is useful. By repeating it, you're telling your brain not to forget this information. In other words, you're using the same technique as advertisers to prepare for your tests!

This concept has a scientific basis. In the 19th century, a German psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered what he called the "Forgetting Curve." This showed how quickly the brain forgets information if it isn't used over time. His research led to the development of a technique called "Spaced Repetition," which determines how often you should practice remembering something to prevent forgetting it.

So, the next time you see an ad, you can imagine a company out there with a giant flashcard, trying to get your brain to remember their cereal or candy! It's a bit like they're preparing your brain for a "test" for when you are at the store.

This brings up a question: How can we become more aware of these "flashcards in the wild" and be more intentional about what we expose our brains to? Just as you choose what to put on your study flashcards, could we be more selective about the information we allow to repeat in our minds?

Love,
Abba
