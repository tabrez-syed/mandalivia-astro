Rea,

Have you ever been so caught up in a moment of anger that it felt like nothing else mattered? There's a story from Zen Buddhism that might change how you think about those moments.

Once upon a time, a man was rowing his boat on a peaceful river. The water was calm, the sun was shining, and he was enjoying the tranquility of the day. Suddenly, another boat came crashing into his, jolting him out of his peaceful state. He was furious! He looked around, ready to shout at whoever was responsible for ruining his day.

But when he looked closer, he realized something surprising - the other boat was empty. It had simply drifted downstream, carried by the current. There was no one to blame, no one to shout at. In that moment, his anger vanished, replaced by a sense of understanding.

This story, known as the "Empty Boat," teaches us an important lesson about anger and blame. Often, when we feel angry, it's because we assume someone else is at fault. But sometimes, like the empty boat, the situation isn't anyone's fault at all. It's just the way things are.

The next time you find yourself getting upset, try to remember the empty boat. Ask yourself if there's really someone to blame, or if it's just the current of life carrying things along. You might find that letting go of anger can lead to a surprising sense of peace.

Love,
Abba

P.S. Can you think of a time when you were angry, but later realized there was no one to blame? How did it feel to let that anger go?
