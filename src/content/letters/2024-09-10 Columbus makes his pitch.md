Dear Rea,

I heard you're learning about the Age of Exploration in school, and I bet you've come across Christopher Columbus. This reminded me of our trip to Spain, and I thought I'd share a story connecting what you're learning with our adventures.

Remember our walks through the winding streets of Albayzin in Granada? Or our visit to the magnificent Alhambra palace? Well, imagine this: over 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus walked those very same paths. Unlike us tourists, he was there on a crucial mission.

Columbus had a big dream - to find a new route to Asia by sailing west across the Atlantic. In 1485, he started lobbying for support, presenting his ideas to various European courts. For years, he faced rejection after rejection. He tried Portugal first, then Genoa and Venice, but no one was interested. In 1486, Columbus arrived in Spain to seek support from Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. But even they didn't say yes. For six long years, Columbus persistently presented his case to the Spanish monarchs.

Here's where it gets really interesting. Remember the Reconquista we learned about in Spain? On January 2, 1492, Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, finally submitted to Spanish rule. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand set up their court in the Alhambra palace to govern their newly unified kingdom.

Imagine Columbus, walking through the same Alhambra halls we explored, making his final pitch to the monarchs. They had just achieved their long-held goal of uniting Spain and were ready to look beyond their borders. Columbus's timing was perfect!

On April 17, 1492, just a few months after Granada's fall, Columbus finally received approval for his voyage. He set sail on August 3, 1492, beginning his famous journey across the Atlantic.

Just imagine the conviction Columbus had to keep pursuing his dream for so many years. Ironically, he was wrong - he didn't discover a western route to Asia! That's why it's called the Age of Exploration, I guess. To venture into the unknown.

Next time you face a challenge or someone says "no" to your idea, remember Columbus. Keep trying, keep improving your plan, and wait for the right moment. You never know when your persistence might pay off!

Love,Â Abba
