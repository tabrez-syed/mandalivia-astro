Rea,

You mentioned the other day that Greek mythology seemed boring and far away from your life. But what if I told you that these ancient stories are actually hiding in many of your favorite books - even Harry Potter?

Let me tell you about an ancient Greek story that might sound familiar. It's about a boy named Icarus who was trapped in a tower with his father, Daedalus. Daedalus was a brilliant inventor who came up with an amazing escape plan: he would build wings for them both using wooden frames, wax, and feathers.

As Daedalus carefully crafted each wing, he gave his son an important warning. "Icarus," he said, "these wings will give us freedom, but they come with two dangers. If you fly too low, the sea spray will make the feathers too heavy and wet. If you fly too high, the sun will melt the wax holding the feathers together. You must find the middle path - not too high, not too low."

At first, Icarus followed his father's instructions perfectly. But as he got more comfortable with flying, he started to forget the warning. The feeling of flying was so amazing that he wanted more. He flew higher and higher, ignoring his father's calls, until the sun melted the wax and he fell from the sky.

Does this story remind you of anyone? Think about Harry Potter's first flying lesson. Remember how Madam Hooch specifically warned everyone not to fly their brooms until she returned? But Harry, seeing Malfoy with Neville's Remembrall, couldn't resist. He flew brilliantly - but he also could have been expelled! Just like Icarus, Harry's natural talent and excitement made him forget about being careful.

This pattern shows up again and again in Harry's story. Whether it's sneaking into forbidden corridors, following spiders into the forest, or rushing to the Department of Mysteries, Harry often ignores warnings because he thinks he knows better - just like Icarus did.

That's what makes Greek mythology so interesting - these ancient stories show up in new forms because they tell us something true about being human. The same challenges that Icarus faced (like not listening to warnings when excited) are challenges that Harry Potter faces, and that you and I face too.

Love,
Abba

P.S. Next time you're reading a book, see if you can spot any other ancient stories hiding inside. You might be surprised how many you find!
