Dear Rea,

Yesterday, I shared the story of the king and his leather shoes. Today, I'd like to tell you another tale I learned when I first started meditating. It's a story that reminds us how challenges can actually help us grow.

Once upon a time, there was a renowned meditation teacher who attracted students from all over the world. People came to stay at his temple, eager to learn from his wisdom. Generally, the students were a peaceful and calm group, living together in harmony.

But there was one student who stood out. He was rude, disruptive, and seemed to enjoy making others angry. He was like a thorn in everyone's side, constantly stirring up trouble and upsetting the other students.

Many times, the other students approached the teacher, pleading with him to send this troublemaker away. They argued that his presence was ruining the peaceful atmosphere of the temple. But each time, the wise teacher would gently wave off their complaints, asking them instead to focus on their own practice.

Years passed, and eventually, the great teacher passed away. As the students were going through the temple's records, they made a surprising discovery. The teacher had actually been paying the rude student to stay at the center all along! Can you guess why? The teacher understood that their meditation practice couldn't truly progress without some difficulty. He knew that facing challenges was an essential part of their growth.

This might seem strange at first, but think about it: when you're practicing soccer, you don't just kick the ball straight ahead. You work on difficult passes and tricky maneuvers. When you're doing math homework, you tackle problems that stretch your skills. Remember, you can't get better at something until you're willing to be not-so-good at it first.

So, Rea, I'd like you to think about the challenges in your life right now. What are the "necessary difficulties" you're facing? Maybe it's a subject at school that you find tough, or a disagreement with a friend, or even a chore at home that you don't enjoy. Can you look at these challenges from a new perspective? Instead of seeing them as annoying obstacles, can you view them as opportunities to grow stronger, smarter, or more patient?

Remember, just like the students at the meditation temple, sometimes the things that bother us the most are the very things helping us become better versions of ourselves. What do you think about the teacher's unusual method? Can you think of a time when a difficulty in your life ended up teaching you something valuable?

Love,
Abba
