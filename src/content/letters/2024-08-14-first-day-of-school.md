Dear Rea,

It's been a few weeks since I last wrote to you, and I must admit, I feel a bit rusty. But today is a special day - your first day of fifth grade! I'm bursting with excitement, both because of your enthusiasm and because of how much joy I find in learning alongside you. Your school projects about Texas history and the beauty of our national parks, as well as the podcasts you listen to, have taught me so much.

Speaking of journeys, I want to share a story with you about Jigoro Kano, the founder of Judo. You probably know that in martial arts, colored belts signify a student's level - like grades in school. A white belt is like being in kindergarten, while a black belt often means you're an expert, maybe even a teacher.

Now, here's the fascinating part: When Kano was quite old and nearing the end of his life, he gathered his students and made an unusual request. He asked to be buried in a white belt. Can you imagine why? This man, an expert who had created an entire martial art, wanted to be remembered as a beginner.

Kano understood that a beginner's mind is filled with curiosity and wonder, always open to learning. An expert might say, "I already know that," missing the chance to see things with fresh eyes and discover something new.

As you step into your new classroom today, I encourage you to put on your imaginary white belt. Approach each subject, each lesson, with the openness and excitement of a beginner. You might be surprised at how much you can learn, even about things you think you already know!

And guess what? I'm putting on my white belt too. Because no matter how old we get or how much we think we know, there's always something new to learn.

So, here's to a new school year full of wonder, curiosity, and learning. I can't wait to hear about all the amazing things you'll discover!

Love,
Abba
