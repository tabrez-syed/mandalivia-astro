Rea,

Have you ever had to do something really important, but found yourself wanting to do something more fun instead? Like when you need to finish homework but there's a really good book waiting to be read?

How do you manage to get the work done when you really don't want to? There's an ancient Greek story about exactly this challenge. It's about Odysseus, one of the greatest heroes of mythology, and how he figured out a clever way to handle the most tempting distraction in the world: the Sirens.

The Sirens were mysterious creatures who lived on an island and sang the most beautiful music anyone had ever heard. Their voices were so enchanting that sailors would forget everything else - steering their ships, watching for rocks, even eating or drinking - just to listen. Every ship that passed their island would crash on the rocks, but the sailors didn't care. They were too captivated by the song.

When Odysseus learned his ship would have to pass by the Sirens' island, he did something surprising. Instead of trying to be brave enough to resist the song, he admitted that even he - a legendary hero - wouldn't be strong enough. So he came up with a plan.

First, he had his sailors plug their ears with wax so they couldn't hear the song at all. But Odysseus himself wanted to hear the famous music without putting everyone in danger. So he had his crew tie him tightly to the ship's mast. He made them promise not to untie him, no matter how much he begged or ordered them to do so.

When they passed the island, Odysseus heard the Sirens' song. It was more beautiful than anything he'd imagined, and he desperately wanted to swim to their island. He struggled against the ropes and shouted at his crew to untie him. But because of his own plan - the wax in their ears and the strong ropes - they kept rowing, and the ship passed safely.

Odysseus was considered wise not because he was strong enough to resist temptation, but because he was smart enough to plan ahead. He knew that in the moment of challenge, even the strongest person might make bad choices. So he created a system to help himself succeed.

What if you could come up with plans like this for your own challenges? Maybe you could ask a friend to be your study buddy, or set up a special quiet space for homework where you can't see the fun things that might distract you. 

Love,
Abba

P.S. Next time you're facing a challenge, remember: sometimes the smartest strategy isn't trying to be perfect in the moment - it's making a good plan ahead of time.
