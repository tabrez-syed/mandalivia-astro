Rea,

This week, while you're reading this letter, people around the world are gathering at meditation centers for a special week of practice called Rohatsu. I'm at one of these gatherings, where we remember and recreate one of history's most remarkable nights of discovery.

You might remember the story of the Buddha - how he left his palace life of luxury to understand why there's suffering in the world. At first, he tried living with absolutely nothing, practicing such extreme austerity that his body became so thin he could touch his spine by pressing his stomach. But after years of these harsh practices, he realized that neither a life of luxury nor one of extreme deprivation would lead to the answers he sought.

Then he remembered something from his childhood - a time when he sat quietly under a tree, feeling peaceful and clear-minded. This memory led him to make an extraordinary decision. He sat down under a special fig tree (now known as the Bodhi tree) and made a powerful vow: he would not move from that spot until he understood the true nature of suffering and happiness, even if it meant sitting forever!

As he sat through the night, according to the story, a force called Mara tried everything to break his determination. Mara sent storms, fears, and all kinds of distractions - much like when you're trying to focus on something important and suddenly everything else seems more interesting! But the Buddha stayed steady, keeping his attention focused through the cold night, through his legs falling asleep, through all the challenges that arose.

Finally, as the morning star appeared in the sky just before dawn, he made his discovery - one that would help millions of people understand their own minds better.

This week at Zen centers everywhere, people recreate that experience of determination. The meditation hall grows quiet and still as practitioners face their own versions of Mara - sleepiness, restless legs, wondering if they'll make it through another period of meditation. But just like the Buddha, they stay with it, supporting each other in silence as they remember his journey of discovery.

It's amazing to think that after 2,500 years, people still gather to remember and learn from this profound experience. Sometimes the most important insights don't come from having everything or nothing, but from simply staying present with whatever challenges we face.

Love,
Abba

P.S. What would you be willing to sit with until you truly understood it?
