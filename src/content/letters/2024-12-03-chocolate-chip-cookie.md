Rea,

Did you know one of the world's favorite cookies was invented by someone trying to make a completely different dessert? Sometimes the best discoveries happen when things don't go according to plan!

Back in 1938, Ruth Wakefield was the owner of the Toll House Inn, a popular restaurant in Massachusetts known for its delicious home-style cooking. One day, while preparing her famous chocolate butter cookies, Ruth decided to try something different. She chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar, expecting the pieces to melt completely and create chocolate cookies.

But something unexpected happened. When she pulled the cookies out of the oven, the chocolate hadn't melted into the dough at all! Instead, the pieces had softened but kept their shape, creating little pockets of chocolate throughout the cookies. Ruth was surprised - this wasn't what she planned at all! But when she tasted one of these "mistake" cookies, she realized she had accidentally created something amazing.

Her customers thought so too. Soon, everyone was asking for Ruth's "chocolate chip cookies." The recipe became so popular that Nestlé noticed their chocolate bar sales increasing dramatically in the Massachusetts area. When they discovered why, they made a deal with Ruth: they would print her recipe on their chocolate bar packages, and she would have a lifetime supply of chocolate!

But the story gets even better. Nestlé then had another clever idea - why not pre-chop the chocolate for bakers? In 1939, they started selling small chunks of chocolate, and eventually created the teardrop-shaped morsels we know today. All because of one unexpected baking result!

The science behind why the cookies worked is fascinating too. Chocolate chips are specially designed to resist melting - they contain just the right mix of cocoa butter and other ingredients to soften in the oven's heat without losing their shape. That's why even today, when you bite into a warm chocolate chip cookie, you get that perfect combination of soft cookie and melty (but not completely melted) chocolate.

Isn't it amazing how some of our favorite things come from "mistakes"? Just like when you're experimenting in the kitchen or working on a science project, sometimes the most interesting discoveries happen when things don't go exactly as planned. The key is being curious enough to taste that unexpected result!

Love,
Abba
