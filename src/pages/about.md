Once upon a time, in 1988, an eight-year-old boy dreamed of an island.

It emerged, quite unexpectedly, from the depths of the Indian Ocean -
a pristine territory unclaimed by any nation, untouched by any map.
He named it Mandalivia.

In his childhood imagination, this island became a playground of possibilities.
Its economy flourished with chocolate coins, its parliament debated the
merits of longer recess hours, and its chief export was perhaps dreams
themselves.

Years later, when the digital seas of the internet opened new frontiers,
Mandalivia found its new shore here, at mandalivia.com. The boy,
now grown but still dreaming, established this virtual embassy of imagination.

Today, Mandalivia hosts two main attractions:

- [Letters](/letters): Daily dispatches to his daughter, building bridges across time
- [Wonderings](/blog): A collection of thoughts, like seashells gathered along
  the shore of consciousness

This website, like the imaginary island that inspired it, remains in a
perpetual state of play and discovery. New territories may be added,
old paths might be redrawn, but the spirit of that eight-year-old's
dream lives on in every pixel.

Welcome to Mandalivia. Feel free to explore its shores.
