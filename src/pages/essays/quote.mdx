            Once, a university professor visited a famous Zen master, hoping to learn about Zen. However, as soon as they sat down, the professor began talking non-stop about his own ideas and opinions on Zen. He spoke of all the books he had read and the concepts he had studied, barely pausing for breath.

The Zen master listened patiently and then said, "Shall we have some tea?" The professor nodded, still continuing his lecture

The master poured the visitor's cup to the brim and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself.

"It's full! No more will go in!" the professor burst out.

"Like this cup," the master replied, "you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"
